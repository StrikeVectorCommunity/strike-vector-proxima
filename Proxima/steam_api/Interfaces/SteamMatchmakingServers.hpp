	/* the filter operation codes that go in the key part of MatchMakingKeyValuePair_t should be one of these:

		"map"
			- Server passes the filter if the server is playing the specified map.
		"gamedataand"
			- Server passes the filter if the server's game data (ISteamGameServer::SetGameData) contains all of the
			specified strings.  The value field is a comma-delimited list of strings to match.
		"gamedataor"
			- Server passes the filter if the server's game data (ISteamGameServer::SetGameData) contains at least one of the
			specified strings.  The value field is a comma-delimited list of strings to match.
		"gamedatanor"
			- Server passes the filter if the server's game data (ISteamGameServer::SetGameData) does not contain any
			of the specified strings.  The value field is a comma-delimited list of strings to check.
		"gametagsand"
			- Server passes the filter if the server's game tags (ISteamGameServer::SetGameTags) contains all
			of the specified strings.  The value field is a comma-delimited list of strings to check.
		"gametagsnor"
			- Server passes the filter if the server's game tags (ISteamGameServer::SetGameTags) does not contain any
			of the specified strings.  The value field is a comma-delimited list of strings to check.
		"and" (x1 && x2 && ... && xn)
		"or" (x1 || x2 || ... || xn)
		"nand" !(x1 && x2 && ... && xn)
		"nor" !(x1 || x2 || ... || xn)
			- Performs Boolean operation on the following filters.  The operand to this filter specifies
			the "size" of the Boolean inputs to the operation, in Key/value pairs.  (The keyvalue
			pairs must immediately follow, i.e. this is a prefix logical operator notation.)
			In the simplest case where Boolean expressions are not nested, this is simply
			the number of operands.

			For example, to match servers on a particular map or with a particular tag, would would
			use these filters.

				( server.map == "cp_dustbowl" || server.gametags.contains("payload") )
				"or", "2"
				"map", "cp_dustbowl"
				"gametagsand", "payload"

			If logical inputs are nested, then the operand specifies the size of the entire
			"length" of its operands, not the number of immediate children.

				( server.map == "cp_dustbowl" || ( server.gametags.contains("payload") && !server.gametags.contains("payloadrace") ) )
				"or", "4"
				"map", "cp_dustbowl"
				"and", "2"
				"gametagsand", "payload"
				"gametagsnor", "payloadrace"

			Unary NOT can be achieved using either "nand" or "nor" with a single operand.

		"addr"
			- Server passes the filter if the server's query address matches the specified IP or IP:port.
		"gameaddr"
			- Server passes the filter if the server's game address matches the specified IP or IP:port.

		The following filter operations ignore the "value" part of MatchMakingKeyValuePair_t

		"dedicated"
			- Server passes the filter if it passed true to SetDedicatedServer.
		"secure"
			- Server passes the filter if the server is VAC-enabled.
		"notfull"
			- Server passes the filter if the player count is less than the reported max player count.
		"hasplayers"
			- Server passes the filter if the player count is greater than zero.
		"noplayers"
			- Server passes the filter if it doesn't have any players.
		"linux"
			- Server passes the filter if it's a linux server
